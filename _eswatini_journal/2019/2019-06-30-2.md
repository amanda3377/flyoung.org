It’s a beautiful day to know more about this beautiful country, so we went to the capital city, Mbabane to start our adventure.

We separated into 3 groups to complete our missions given. As we arrived at the plaza, we noticed a girl with special hairstyle and decided to take a photo with her. However, we realised that there were people with cool hairstyles everywhere. Following the path, here comes to the bus station. Luckily, we met a Swazi man who studied in Taiwan before and he told us about the religions in eSwatini. The world is really small that we met him at this place and he studied in the university which is located at my hometown!

After the adventure, some of us had lunch at Green Chilli. The Indian cuisine was so nice that I really enjoyed my meal. I would like to introduce their curry, biryani, chicken tikka and naan for people who will visit eSwatini in the future! Every time I go back to Taiwan, I miss these a lot!

Today is a wonderful day that I get to know more about eSwatini. I also enjoyed the walk in town where I know very well. I hope this is a nice beginning of our one-month-journey.
